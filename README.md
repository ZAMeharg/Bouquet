# Bouquet
Created for BIOL 7180-D01 Scripting for Biologist @ Auburn University

## Goals of the program
Create a functional program that will analyse floral images to get a color percentage in either RGB or Hexadecimal.
At this time to plan of the program is to use python to:
1. Read the image as an input
2. Remove the background or make the background a solid color that will not appear in any of the flowers ex) Green
3. Calculate the percentage of the dominant colors to generate a RGB and/or a Hexadecimal value
4. Additional features that might be included would be a way to store the images in a vase.txt file that will have the location of all the images used in a round of image analysis
5. Using the 'arrangement' function to arrange the images into a .jpeg or .png image that will be sorted by color.

### Example
> Bouquet.py <insert path to image><Image_name> <br>
> Image_name: RGB, Hexadecimal
>
> Boquet.py Boom_Boom_White_1.jpeg <br>
> Boom Boom White: 255,255,255 #FFFFFF
>
